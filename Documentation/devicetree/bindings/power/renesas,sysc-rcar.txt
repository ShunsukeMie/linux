DT bindings for the Renesas R-Car System Controller

== System Controller Node ==

The R-Car System Controller provides power management for the CPU cores and
various coprocessors.

Required properties:
  - compatible: Must contain one or more of the following:
      - "renesas,r8a7779-sysc" (R-Car H1)
      - "renesas,r8a7790-sysc" (R-Car H2)
      - "renesas,r8a7791-sysc" (R-Car M2-W)
      - "renesas,r8a7792-sysc" (R-Car V2H)
      - "renesas,r8a7793-sysc" (R-Car M2-N)
      - "renesas,r8a7794-sysc" (R-Car E2)
      - "renesas,r8a7795-sysc" (R-Car H3)
      - "renesas,rcar-gen2-sysc" (Generic R-Car Gen2)
      - "renesas,rcar-gen3-sysc" (Generic R-Car Gen3)
    When compatible with the generic version, nodes must list the SoC-specific
    version corresponding to the platform first, followed by the generic
    version.
  - reg: Address start and address range for the device.
  - pm-domains: This node contains a hierarchy of PM Domain Nodes.
    Dependencies (e.g. parent SCUs should not be powered off while child CPUs
    are on) should be reflected using subnodes.


== PM Domain Nodes ==

Each of the PM domain nodes represents a PM domain, as documented by the
generic PM domain bindings in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt.

Required properties:
  - #power-domain-cells: Must be 0.
  - reg: This property must contain 2 values:
	   - The first value is the number of the interrupt bit representing
	     the power area in the various Interrupt Registers (e.g. SYSCISR,
	     Interrupt Status Register),
	   - The second value encodes the power register block offset (which is
	     a multiple of 64), and the number of the bit representing the
	     power area in the various Power Control Registers (e.g. PWROFFSR,
	     Power Shutoff Status Register). This value is created by ORing
	     these two numbers.
	 The parent's node must contain the following two properties:
	   - #address-cells: Must be 2,
	   - #size-cells: Must be 0.


Example:

	sysc: system-controller@e6180000 {
		compatible = "renesas,r8a7791-sysc", "renesas,rcar-gen2-sysc";
		reg = <0 0xe6180000 0 0x0200>;

		pm-domains {
			#address-cells = <2>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			pd_ca15_scu: scu@12 {
				reg = <12 0x180>;
				#address-cells = <2>;
				#size-cells = <0>;
				#power-domain-cells = <0>;

				pd_ca15_cpu0: cpu@0 {
					reg = <0 0x40>;
					#power-domain-cells = <0>;
				};

				pd_ca15_cpu1: cpu@1 {
					reg = <1 0x41>;
					#power-domain-cells = <0>;
				};
			};

			pd_sh: sh@16 {
				reg = <16 0x80>;
				#power-domain-cells = <0>;
			};

			pd_sgx: sgx@20 {
				reg = <20 0xc0>;
				#power-domain-cells = <0>;
			};
		};
	};
